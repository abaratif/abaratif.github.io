Welcome to Week 13 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week?

	This week, we turned in the final version of our project.

2. What's in your way?

	The course is almost over now, and the next few classes will be used for project presentations. The only thing that really still stands in the way is the final exam!

3. What will you do next week?

	Next week, I plan on preparing for the final exam. I hope to study very hard and finish strong in the class.

4. Experiences

	Overall, the class has been a great learning experience. It has had some frustrating moments to be sure, but I felt like I learned a lot of new skills and got to work with a lot of interesting new tools. I had a great time working with my group and felt like I was able to learn a lot from them.

5. Tip of the week

	Last week, I suggested using [slides](https://slides.com), but would no longer reccomend it. We were unable to export our presentation, so we had to redo the whole thing in PowerPoint!
