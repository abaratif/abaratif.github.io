Welcome to Week 10 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week?

	We worked on the second version of our project. Also learned about XML, JSON, and Regular Expressions.


2. What's in your way?

	I'll need to get some more practice with regular expressions.

3. What will you do next week?

	I plan to keep working on the project and to study up on Regular Expressions.

4. Experiences

	We had another guest speaker (or rather, set of guest speakers) this week from Atlassian. It was cool to hear about their equivalent versions of some of the tools we use. It seems like they have a very comprehensive suite of tools which are used by a large number of companies.

5. Tip of the week

	Check out [Spark](http://sparkjava.com), a Java web app framework. It seems to be similar to Flask in terms of being lightweight.
