Welcome to Week 11 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week?

	This week, we mostly worked on more SQL and began working on some refactoring.


2. What's in your way?

	My Java knowledge is weak! I've forgotten some of the nuances of the language, and the refactoring lectures made me realize how rusty I am.

3. What will you do next week?

	Work on the last phase of the project, and study for the exam.

4. Experiences

	Nothing too interesting to report this week. Everything has been going smoothly with the project. Now that it is near completion, I'm ready to turn my attention to preparing for the exam.

5. Tip of the week

	We used [slides](https://slides.com), which is sort of like Prezi to prepare our presentation. It is pretty cool, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a way to prepare slides.
