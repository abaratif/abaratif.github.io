Welcome to Week 14 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week?

	Started studying for the final exam.

2. What's in your way?

	There is a lot of material to cover for the final. I also have three other exams this week, so I really have my work cut out for me.

3. What will you do next week?

	I will continue studying for the exam, and will take the exam.

4. Experiences

	Had some bad experiences with Carina again this weekend! This time, I'm unable to access the cluster at all, and am seeing an error status on the web interface. I tweeted Rackspace support and emailed them, so hopefully it will be resolved in time to present the project.

5. Tip of the week

	Use Twitter! Tweeting about issues is a great way to get help quickly.
