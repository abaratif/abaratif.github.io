title: Week 15 - Final Blog
---

Welcome to Week 15 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week?

	Took the final.

2. What's in your way?

	Nothing! The course is officially done.

3. Experiences

	I felt more prepared for this exam, as I felt like I was more familiar with the material conceptually, and had worked through a good amount of examples. Overall I felt like I did well and it was a good end to the course.

	Overall, I am really glad I took this course. It was certainly time consuming, and could be overwhelming at times, but it has been one of the most interesting courses I've taken during my time. I would certainly be registered for OOP if I wasn't graduating, and would recommend all CS majors to take at least one of these two classes.

4. Tip of the week
	Use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as your text editor! One of the features I really enjoy is being able to open files and directories from the terminal by typing atom <filename>.
