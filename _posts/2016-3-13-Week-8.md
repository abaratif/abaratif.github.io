Welcome to Week 8 of the CS 373 Blog.

1. What did you do this past week? 
	
	This week was mostly spent on working on the new IDB1 project. The beginning of the week consisted mainly of logistical challenges like organizing our group and coming up with ideas. Later, we started looking for a data source, and designing our data models. 
 	

2. What's in your way?
	
	This project seems like it will involve a lot of different components, so the challenge will probably be putting everything together in a seamless way and making sure the final project works properly and is easy to use.

3. What will you do next week?
	
	Our team will continue working on the project and will hopefully have a good finished product.

4. Experiences

	We had another guest speaker this week. This one was from Rackspace, and he showed us about Docker, which we will use as an alternative to VMs. Docker seems like it offers performance improvements over a VM, but it seems like there are still some kinks that need to be worked out with it.

5. Tip of the week

	[This docker tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAAzevEST2qm2Xbe3aeLFvLc) seems like it will contain a lot of good information. I haven't checked it out yet, but LearnCode academy has some other great youtube videos I have watched before.
